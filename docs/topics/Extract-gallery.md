# Extract gallery

FoliCon serves Professional mode data from DeviantArt, Where creators can directly upload a single image or sometimes a archive(such as zip, rar) of images. 
FoliCon can extract and let you choose from them as well.

Right-Click on any image in search results of professional mode and click on `Extract Gallery` to extract the images from the archive.

The extracted images will be shown in a new window where you can select/preview the image you want to set as the folder icon.
